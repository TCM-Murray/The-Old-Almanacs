# Jen Almanac's Modpack Development

This repository is for the development and version management of the "Jen Almanac's" Balatro modpack. 
It contains several branches, each representing a different version or stage of the modpack.

This repository has only bugfixes in mind. I do not have in mind to add new mods or support them. I will only fix bugs that come from the main branch.

## Branches

*   **`main`**: This is the primary development branch. It contains the stable, working version of the modpack with the latest bugfixes.
*   **`base`**: This branch holds the original, unmodified base modpack. It serves as a clean blueprint.
*   **`experimental-updates`**: This branch is for testing updated mods. It has all Jen Almanac's dependencies updated (smods, Cryptid, Talisman, Cartomancer, MoreFluff). It is unstable and is not intended for general use. It is too complex for me to work on.
*   **`jen-almanac-dependencies`**: This branch contains a stripped-down version of the modpack with only the essential dependencies for the "Jen Almanac's" mod. Those are updated as well, so it wont work either.
